/*
 * A graph is a data structure that consists of the following two components:
    1. A finite set of vertices also called as nodes.
    2. A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge.
            The pair is ordered because (u, v) is not the same as (v, u)     in  case     of a    directed graph(di-graph).


    The pair of the form (u, v) indicates that there is an edge from vertex u to     vertex v.
    The edges may  contain     weight/value/cost.
    Graphs are used to represent many real-life applications: Graphs are used to represent networks.
        The networks may include paths     in a    city    or    telephone network or circuit network.
        Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, Facebook.
        For example,  in Facebook,     each  person is represented with a vertex(or node). Each node is a structure and contains   information like person   id, name, gender,    and locale.    See this for more applications of graph.

/*
 * The following two are the most commonly used representations of a graph.
            1. Adjacency Matrix
            2. Adjacency List
    There are other representations also like, Incidence Matrix and Incidence List. The choice of graph representation is situation-specific. It totally depends on the type of operations to be performed and ease of use.
